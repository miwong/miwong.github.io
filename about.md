I grew up in Toronto and am currently a PhD student at the University of Toronto. My interests lie in computer engineering, namely
computer security, with additional experience in parallel programming and image processing.  I recently completed my Master of Applied
Science (MASc) degree, supervised by Professor David Lie. I did my undergrad in the Engineering Science program at the 
University of Toronto (class of 1T1+PEY).
