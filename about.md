I grew up in Toronto and am currently a graduate student at the University of Toronto. My interests lie in computer engineering,
with experience in parallel programming, image processing, computer security.  I am currently working on my Master of Applied
Science degree, supervised by Professor David Lie. My undergraduate degree is from the Engineering Science program at the 
University of Toronto (class of 1T1+PEY).  

My main hobbies involve homemade crafts, using a variety of techniques.  I have taken classes in metal work and glass flameworking. 
I also create jewelry and opened an Etsy shop several years ago.  

I love playing board games and am always looking for new ones to try.  My current favourites are Dominion, Bang! and Betrayal
at House on the Hill.
