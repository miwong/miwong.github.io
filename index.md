I am currently a graduate student at the Univesity of Toronto, working towords a Master of Applied Science (M.A.Sc.) degree.
My research is focused on computer security on mobile platforms.  Currently, I am working on a targeted dynamic analysis tool
to analyze and detect malware on the Android platform.
